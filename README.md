# closa-timeline
a JS timeLine Component in REACT

This component allows to have a handly Timeline that will display on a 
page, with alternating view, the following: 

a date , an Icon and arrow used as separator and a Title, Location, and decsription card on the other side. That is from left to right and right to left. 

It is done with pure React and simple Css. The advantge is that there is a 
strong link between what the programmer manipulates and what the final result is. No npm libraries and full control. 

I have used it in a site as is, just changing the css to adapt to the color pattern on the receiving page. 

see https://ferranclosa.eu, the Timeline menu for example.
